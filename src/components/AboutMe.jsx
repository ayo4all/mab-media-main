                <p className='font-medium text-justify'> I've been able to advance my career as a videographer over the past eight years, going from a beginner to recording weddings of exceptional individuals, music videos, live events, and drone footage. These are just a handful of the areas in which I excel. </p>

                <p className='font-medium mt-3 text-justify'> However, my favorite areas to work have been on wedding and music video shoots. I enjoy my job as a videographer because I get to capture and witness real feelings of love between couples and the passion of artists. View some of my projects to understand what I mean.</p>
